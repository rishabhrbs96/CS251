        \subsection{Introduction}
Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. Released in 1989, it has been distributed widely as the shell for the GNU operating system and as a default shell on Linux and OS X. It was announced during the 2016 Build Conference that Windows 10 has added a Linux subsystem which fully supports Bash and other Ubuntu binaries running natively in Windows. In the past, and currently, it has also ported to Microsoft Windows and distributed with Cygwin and MinGW, to DOS by the DJGPP project, to Novell NetWare and to Android via various terminal emulation applications. In the late 1990s, Bash was a minor player among multiple commonly used shells; at present Bash has overwhelming favor.
    \subsection{GREP}
    grep is a command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines matching a \textbf{regular expression}. Grep was originally developed for the Unix operating system, but is available today for all Unix-like systems. Its name comes from the ed command g/re/p (\textbf{g}lobally search a \textbf{re}gular expression and \textbf{p}rint), which has the same effect: doing a global search with the regular expression and printing all matching lines.
        \subsection{SED}
    sed (stream editor) is a Unix utility that parses and transforms text, using a simple, compact programming language. \textbf{sed} was developed from 1973 to 1974 by Lee E. McMahon of Bell Labs, and is available today for most operating systems. sed was based on the scripting features of the interactive editor ed ("editor", 1971) and the earlier qed ("quick editor", 1965â€“66). sed was one of the earliest tools to support regular expressions, and remains in use for text processing, most notably with the substitution command. Other options for doing "stream editing" include AWK and Perl.

	\section{Latex}
	\LaTeX is a typesetting system that is very suitable for producing scientific and mathematical documents of high typographical quality. It is also suitable for producing all sorts of other documents, from simple letters to complete books.\\
	\\
	\LaTeX enables authors to typeset and print their work at the highest typographical quality, using a predefined, professional layout. \LaTeX was originally written by Leslie Lamport.\\
	
	\LaTeX commands are case sensitive, and take one of the following two formats:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item They start with a backslash \textbackslash and then have a name consisting of
		letters only. Command names are terminated by a space, a number or
		any other 'non-letter.'
		\item They consist of a backslash and exactly one non-letter.
		\item Many commands exist in a 'starred variant' where a star is appended
		to the command name.
	\end{enumerate}
