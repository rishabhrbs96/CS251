	\section{Bash}
        \subsection{Introduction}
Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. Released in 1989, it has been distributed widely as the shell for the GNU operating system and as a default shell on Linux and OS X. It was announced during the 2016 Build Conference that Windows 10 has added a Linux subsystem which fully supports Bash and other Ubuntu binaries running natively in Windows. In the past, and currently, it has also ported to Microsoft Windows and distributed with Cygwin and MinGW, to DOS by the DJGPP project, to Novell NetWare and to Android via various terminal emulation applications. In the late 1990s, Bash was a minor player among multiple commonly used shells; at present Bash has overwhelming favor.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
        For quick display of files:
        \begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
            \$ cat helloworld.sh
            #!/bin/bash
            echo Hello World
        \end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}
    \subsection{GREP}
    grep is a command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines matching a \textbf{regular expression}. Grep was originally developed for the Unix operating system, but is available today for all Unix-like systems. Its name comes from the ed command g/re/p (\textbf{g}lobally search a \textbf{re}gular expression and \textbf{p}rint), which has the same effect: doing a global search with the regular expression and printing all matching lines.

Some basic grep commands are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
        For basic string search:
        \begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
            \$ grep "literal\_string" filename
        \end{lstlisting}
    \item
        For case insensitive search:
        \begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
            \$ grep -i "string" filename
        \end{lstlisting}
    \item
        For regular expressions:
        \begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
            \$ grep  "REGEX" filename
        \end{lstlisting}
    \item
        To display N lines after match:
        \begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
            \$ grep  -A <N> "string" filename
        \end{lstlisting}
    \item
        To display N lines before match:
        \begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
            \$ grep  -B <N> "string" filename
        \end{lstlisting}
    \item
        To display lines which do not contain match:
        \begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
            \$ grep  -v -e "pattern" -e "pattern" filename
        \end{lstlisting}
    \item
        Counting number of matches:
        \begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
            \$ grep  -c "pattern" filename
        \end{lstlisting}
    \item
        To display N lines before match:
        \begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
            \$ grep  -B <N> "string" filename
        \end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}
    \subsection{SED}
    sed (stream editor) is a Unix utility that parses and transforms text, using a simple, compact programming language. \textbf{sed} was developed from 1973 to 1974 by Lee E. McMahon of Bell Labs, and is available today for most operating systems. sed was based on the scripting features of the interactive editor ed ("editor", 1971) and the earlier qed ("quick editor", 1965–66). sed was one of the earliest tools to support regular expressions, and remains in use for text processing, most notably with the substitution command. Other options for doing "stream editing" include AWK and Perl.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item
            To match files and replace:
                \begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
                     sed  -e   ‘s/<find expression>/<replace expression>/’ filename
                \end{lstlisting}
        \item
            To use the match as a part of replace string, we can use the following command:
                \begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
                    sed -n -e  's/United States/& of America/p' country.txt
                    United States of America
                \end{lstlisting}
          \item
            To convert lower case letters to upper case:
                \begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
                    sed 'y/ul/UL/' file.txt
                \end{lstlisting}
  \end{enumerate}
  \subsection{AWK}
AWK is an interpreted programming language designed for text processing and typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool. It is a standard feature of most Unix-like operating systems.

The AWK language is a data-driven scripting language consisting of a set of actions to be taken against streams of textual data – either run directly on files or used as part of a pipeline – for purposes of extracting or transforming text, such as producing formatted reports. The language extensively uses the string datatype, associative arrays (that is, arrays indexed by key strings), and regular expressions. While AWK has a limited intended application domain and was especially designed to support one-liner programs, the language is Turing-complete, and even the early Bell Labs users of AWK often wrote well-structured large AWK programs.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item
            Printing columns:
                \begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
                     awk '/a/ {print $3 "\t" $4}' marks.txt 
                \end{lstlisting}
        \item
            Adding variables:
                \begin{lstlisting}[style=BashInputStyle]
                     awk '/a/{++cnt} END {print "Count=", cnt}' marks.txt
                \end{lstlisting}
  \end{enumerate}

    \section{Octave}
	\section{Latex}
	\LaTeX is a typesetting system that is very suitable for producing scientific and mathematical documents of high typographical quality. It is also suitable for producing all sorts of other documents, from simple letters to complete books.\\
	\\
	\LaTeX enables authors to typeset and print their work at the highest typographical quality, using a predefined, professional layout. \LaTeX was originally written by Leslie Lamport.\\
	
	\LaTeX commands are case sensitive, and take one of the following two formats:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item They start with a backslash \textbackslash and then have a name consisting of
		letters only. Command names are terminated by a space, a number or
		any other 'non-letter.'
		\item They consist of a backslash and exactly one non-letter.
		\item Many commands exist in a 'starred variant' where a star is appended
		to the command name.
	\end{enumerate}
	\subsection{Input File Structure}
	When \LaTeX processes an input file, it expects it to follow a certain structure. Thus every input file must start with the command.
	\begin{verbatim}
		\documentclass{...}
	\end{verbatim}

This specifies what sort of document you intend to write. After that, add commands to influence the style of the whole document, or load packages that add new features to the \LaTeX system. To load such a package you use the command.	\\
	\begin{verbatim}
		\usepackage{...}
	\end{verbatim}
When all the setup work is done, you start the body of the text with the command.
	\begin{verbatim}
		\begin{docu\section{Latex}

	\begin{verbatim}
		\usepackament}
	\end{verbatim}
	Now you enter the text mixed with some useful \LaTeX commands. At the end of the document you add the
	\begin{verbatim}
	\end{document}
	\end{verbatim}
	\subsection{Titles, Chapters, and Sections}
	To help the reader find his or her way through your work, you should divide it into chapters, sections, and subsections. \LaTeX supports this with special commands that take the section title as their argument. It is up to you to use them in the correct order.\\
	The following sectioning commands are available for the \textbf{article} class:
	\begin{verbatim}
	\section{...}
	\subsection{...}
	\subsubsection{...}
	\paragraph{...}
	\subparagraph{...}
	\end{verbatim}
	If you want to split your document into parts without influencing the section or chapter numbering use:
	\begin{verbatim}
		\part{...}
	\end{verbatim}
	\LaTeX creates a table of contents by taking the section headings and page
	numbers from the last compile cycle of the document. The command
	\begin{verbatim}
		\tableofcontents
	\end{verbatim}
	The title of the whole document is generated by issuing a command:
	\begin{verbatim}
		\maketitle
	\end{verbatim}
	a footnote is printed at the foot of the current page. Footnotes should always
	be put after the word or sentence they refer to. Footnotes referring to a
	sentence or part of it should therefore be put after the comma or period.
	\begin{verbatim}
	\footnote{footnote text}
	\end{verbatim}
	In scientific publications it is customary to start with an abstract which gives
	the reader a quick overview of what to expect. \LaTeX provides the \textbf{abstract}
	environment for this purpose. Normally \textbf{abstract} is used in documents
	typeset with the article document clas
	\begin{verbatim}
		\begin{abstract}
			The abstract abstract.
		\end{abstract}
	\end{verbatim}
	
\subsection{Tables}
The tabular environment can be used to typeset beautiful tables with
optional horizontal and vertical lines. \LaTeX determines the width of the
columns automatically.\\

Below you can see the simplest working example of a table :

\begin{verbatim}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c }
cell1 & cell2 & cell3 \\ 
cell4 & cell5 & cell6 \\  
cell7 & cell8 & cell9    
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
	cell1  cell2  cell3
	cell4  cell5  cell6
	cell7  cell8  cell9
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
The tabular environment is more flexible, you can put separator lines in between each column.\\
\end{verbatim}

It was already said that the tabular environment is used to type tables. To be more clear about how it works below is a description of each command.
\begin{verbatim}
{ |c|c|c| }
\end{verbatim}
This declares that three columns, separated by a vertical line, are going to be used in the table. Each c means that the contents of the column will be centred, you can also use r to align the text to the right and l for left alignment. 
\begin{verbatim}
	\hline
\end{verbatim}

This will insert a horizontal line on top of the table and at the bottom too. There is no restriction on the number of times you can use \begin{verbatim}
\hline
\end{verbatim}
. 
\begin{verbatim}
cell1 & cell2 & cell3 \\
Each & is a cell separator and the double-backslash \\ sets the end of this row. 
\end{verbatim}
\subsection{Typesetting Mathematical Formulae}
A mathematical formula can be typeset in-line within a paragraph (text style),
or the paragraph can be broken and the formula typeset separately (display
style). Mathematical equations within a paragraph are entered between \$
and \$:\\

Let's see an example of the \textbf{inline} mode: 

\begin{verbatim}
	In physics, the mass-energy equivalence is stated by the equation $E=mc^2$,
	discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein.
\end{verbatim}

The displayed mode has two versions: numbered and unnumbered.\\
\begin{verbatim}
The mass-energy equivalence is described by the famous equation

$$E=mc^2$$

discovered in 1905 by Albert Einstein. 
In natural units ($c$ = 1), the formula expresses the identity

\begin{equation}
E=m
\end{equation}
\end{verbatim}


The \textit{amsmath} package provides a handful of options for displaying equations. You can choose the layout that better suits your document, even if the equations are really long, or if you have to include several equations in the same line.

\section{gnuplot}
		\textbf{Gnuplot} is a portable command-line driven graphing utility for Linux, OS/2, MS Windows, OSX, VMS, and many other platforms. The source code is copyrighted but freely distributed (i.e., you don't have to pay for it). It was originally created to allow scientists and students to visualize mathematical functions and data interactively, but has grown to support many non-interactive uses such as web scripting. It is also used as a plotting engine by third-party applications like Octave. Gnuplot has been supported and under active development since 1986. \\
		
		A simple example which plots the the three graphs mentioned on the same co-ordinate system:
		\begin{verbatim}
			set title "Some math functions"
			set xrange [-10:10]
			set yrange [-2:2]
			set zeroaxis
			plot (x/4)**2, sin(x), 1/x
			
		\end{verbatim}
		The supported functions include: 
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tabular}{ c c }
			      abs(x)      &      absolute value of x, $|x|$\\
			      acos(x)     &    arc-cosine  of x\\
			      asin(x)     &      arc-sine    of x\\  
			      atan(x)     &      arc-tangent of x\\
			      cos(x)      &      cosine      of x,  x is in radians.\\
			      cosh(x)     &      hyperbolic cosine of x, x is in radians\\
			      erf(x)      &      error function of x\\
			      exp(x)      &      exponential function of x, base e\\
			      inverf(x)   &      inverse error function of x\\
			      invnorm(x)  &      inverse normal distribution of x\\
			      log(x)      &      log of x, base e\\
			      log10(x)    &      log of x, base 10\\
			      norm(x)     &      normal Gaussian distribution function\\
			      rand(x)     &      pseudo-random number generator      \\
			      sgn(x)      &      1 if $x > 0$, -1 if $x < 0$, 0 if $x=0$\\
			      sin(x)      &      sine      of x, x is in radians\\
			      sinh(x)     &      hyperbolic sine of x, x is in radians\\
			      sqrt(x)     &      the square root of x\\
			      tan(x)      &      tangent of x, x is in radians\\
			      tanh(x)     &      hyperbolic tangent of x, x is in radians  
			    \end{tabular}
			\end{center}
\subsection{GNUPLOT SCRIPTS }  
Sometimes, several commands are typed to create a particular plot, and it is easy to make a typographical error when entering a command. To stream- line your plotting operations, several Gnuplot commands may be combined into a single script file. For example, the following file will create a customized display of the force-deflection data:
	 
	 \begin{verbatim}
	       # Gnuplot script file for plotting data in file "force.dat"
	       # This file is called   force.p
	       set   autoscale                        # scale axes automatically
	       unset log                              # remove any log-scaling
	       unset label                            # remove any previous labels
	       set xtic auto                          # set xtics automatically
	       set ytic auto                          # set ytics automatically
	       set title "Force Deflection Data for a Beam and a Column"
	       set xlabel "Deflection (meters)"
	       set ylabel "Force (kN)"
	       set key 0.01,100
	       set label "Yield Point" at 0.003,260
	       set arrow from 0.0028,250 to 0.003,280
	       set xr [0.0:0.022]
	       set yr [0:325]
	       plot    "force.dat" using 1:2 title 'Column' with linespoints , \
	       "force.dat" using 1:3 title 'Beam' with points
	 \end{verbatim}
	 
	 \subsection{CUSTOMIZING YOUR PLOT }
	 Many items may be customized on the plot, such as the ranges of the axes, the labels of the x and y axes, the style of data point, the style of the lines connecting the data points, and the title of the entire plot. 
	 \subsubsection{plot command customization }
	  Plots may be displayed in one of eight styles: lines, points, linespoints, impulses, dots, steps, fsteps, histeps, errorbars, xerrorbars, yerrorbars, xyerrorbars, boxes, boxerrorbars, boxxyerrorbars, financebars, candlesticks or vector To specify the line/point style use the plot command as follows: \\
	  \begin{verbatim}
	        gnuplot> plot "force.dat" using 1:2 title 'Column' with lines, \
	        "force.dat" u 1:3 t 'Beam' w linespoints
	  \end{verbatim}
	  Note that the words: using , title , and with can be abbreviated as: u, t, and w. Also, each line and point style has an associated number. 
	  \subsubsection{ set command customization}
	   Customization of the axis ranges, axis labels, and plot title, as well as many other features, are specified using the set command. Specific examples of the set command follow. (The numerical values used in these examples are arbitrary.) To view your changes type: replot at the gnuplot$>$ prompt at any time. 
	   \begin{verbatim}
	         Create a title:                  > set title "Force-Deflection Data" 
	         Put a label on the x-axis:       > set xlabel "Deflection (meters)"
	         Put a label on the y-axis:       > set ylabel "Force (kN)"
	         Change the x-axis range:         > set xrange [0.001:0.005]
	         Change the y-axis range:         > set yrange [20:500]
	         Have Gnuplot determine ranges:   > set autoscale
	         Move the key:                    > set key 0.01,100
	         Delete the key:                  > unset key
	         Put a label on the plot:         > set label "yield point" at 0.003, 260 
	         Remove all labels:               > unset label
	         Plot using log-axes:             > set logscale
	         Plot using log-axes on y-axis:   > unset logscale; set logscale y 
	         Change the tic-marks:            > set xtics (0.002,0.004,0.006,0.008)
	         Return to the default tics:      > unset xtics; set xtics auto
	         
	         
	   \end{verbatim}
\section{XFig}
Xfig  is a menu-driven tool that allows the user to draw and manipulate
objects interactively under the X Window System.  \emph{ It runs under X
version  } and requires a two- or three-button mouse.
file specifies the name of a file to be edited.   The  objects  in  the
file will be read at the start of xfig.
\\
The figure generated by xfig needs to be post processed by an external tool
to convert to a different, more usable format like JPEG or PNG. This is
usually done with \emph{fig2dev}, a program found in the Transfig package.
\\
XFig was one of the first widely used vector graphics editor (in contrast,
programs like photoshop use raster graphics), which means the images are
essentially stored in forms of bazie curves, basic shapes and straight lines
instead of having separate colors for different pixels. Due to the advent
of other programs like Inkscape which used a lot more of today's available
hardware, the program XFig now belongs as a part of history and is no longer
as popular as it used to be.
