	\LaTeX is a typesetting system that is very suitable for producing scientific and mathematical documents of high typographical quality. It is also suitable for producing all sorts of other documents, from simple letters to complete books.\\
	\\
	\LaTeX enables authors to typeset and print their work at the highest typographical quality, using a predefined, professional layout. \LaTeX was originally written by Leslie Lamport.\\
	
	\LaTeX commands are case sensitive, and take one of the following two formats:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item They start with a backslash \textbackslash and then have a name consisting of
		letters only. Command names are terminated by a space, a number or
		any other 'non-letter.'
		\item They consist of a backslash and exactly one non-letter.
		\item Many commands exist in a 'starred variant' where a star is appended
		to the command name.
	\end{enumerate}
